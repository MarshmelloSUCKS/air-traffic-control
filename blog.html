            <p>If you think whatever job you have is stressful, try being an air traffic controller. If you dare blink, you have the potential of letting planes with 300+ people on board collide into each other. Trying to organize planes and make sure they're flying in the best route possible without getting in the way of other planes can be a task in absolute and utter frustration. If you're able to handle the high amounts of stress that this job throws at you, your mental health is likely that of the pilots of the planes you're controlling. Maybe even better. Thing is, you're not flying a plane. You're helping multiple pilots fly their planes. Except you don't get the satisfaction that plane flying provides you. I guess you do get the satisfaction of helping planes not crash into each other. Hey, at least the pay is good. And you get federal benefits. So while this job does require you to pay attention at all times and be a master at stress management, I'd say it's a good job to have if you like helping planes avoid disaster.</p>
